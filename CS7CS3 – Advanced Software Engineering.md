### Module Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:

1. assess the theory of classic architecture principles and apply an
   appropriate architectural model in a team-based application under
   development;
2. evaluate the quality of object-oriented code against standard principles;
3. refactor object-oriented code to conform to standard OO principles;
4. apply test-driven design principles;
5. assess the theory of team-based software development, and of agile
   processes, and apply in a group project;
6. analyse, specify, design, write and test a large-scale, team-based
   application solving a complex problem;
7. select and apply appropriate structuring mechanisms, data placement
   strategies and code quality techniques for large-scale applications;
8. document and demonstrate a large-scale, team-based application to
   assessors;
9. investigate current state of the art in any software engineering topic.
10. apply online group programming techniques

### Module Content

- The purpose of this course is to expose students to the advanced theory and practice of contemporary software engineering techniques and team-based software development; and to the current state of the art in software engineering research. A core aim of this course is to provide students with experience of developing a large-scale application.
- Upon completion of the course students will have gained experience of analysing, specifying, designing and implementing a large-scale application, as part of a team.
- The projects will be strand specific. In addition to addressing debugging and testing challenges, they will also have been exposed to the challenges posed by communicating with team members and other stakeholders (e.g.potential funders), project management, code integration and demonstrating such an application.

Each year there may be more emphasis on some of these topics than others.

### Teaching and Learning Methods

Teaching and learning methods will include a combination of lectures with the whole class, and group conversations on learning outcomes with each project group during their practice sessions.
